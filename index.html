  <h2>Reading</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Reading is one of my hobbies. I love reading. I have a collection of almost 80-90 storybooks at home and I have read them all atleast 5 times! During lockdown, I spent my days doing nothing but reading. I especially love mystery books like 'Sherlock Holmes' and 'Geronimo Stilton- Secret Agent'. I have also read many adventure books like Famous Five, Secret Seven and Harry Potter series. In the end, I'd just like to conclude with one sentence- I cannot live without reading!.</p>
